# 🚢 Marine Traffic Analyzer
### Created by: **Rishabh Malaiya**, Class 12 (PCM)

This Python GUI project simulates marine traffic congestion on three sea routes and helps suggest the best route for ships to take.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
To build a smart simulation of ship traffic management — inspired by real-world shipping logistics and AI traffic systems. The program helps avoid overloaded sea routes by analyzing ship density.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Random module

## 💡 Features
- Simulates traffic on 3 sea routes
- Detects overloaded routes
- Suggests best available route
- Simple and intuitive interface

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Python GUI development
- Real-life application of logic and simulations
- Thinking like an MIT problem solver!
